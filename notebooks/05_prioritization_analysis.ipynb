    "- Assess whether observed behavioral signals justify differentiated customer actions\n",

    "\n",
    ">Rules:\n",
    ">- Differentiated treatment is permitted only when customer behavior is clearly distinct and defensible\n",
    ">- If defensible differentiation does not exist, standardized handling is mandatory\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Hard exclusions:\n",
    ">- One-time buyers are never eligible for differentiated treatment\n",
    ">- Geographic context cannot be used as a standalone justification\n",
    ">- Early-stage customers may be analyzed but must receive standardized handling\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Enforcement:\n",
    ">- “No differentiation” is a valid and final outcome\n",
    ">- These constraints are fixed and cannot be relaxed in later analysis\n",

    ">Authorized bands:\n",
